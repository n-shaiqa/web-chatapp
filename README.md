# Progressive-Web-Chat
A demo chat application that runs as a Progressive Web App using Service Workers, IndexedDB, PushAPI and manifest.json.

### Service Workers
> Service workers are a new browser feature that provide event-driven scripts that run independently of web pages. Unlike other workers, service workers can be shut down at the end of events, note the lack of retained references from documents, and they have access to domain-wide events such as network fetches.

### Manifest
The manifest is a JSON file which is placed in the root directory of a web application. Through the manifest, it is possible to create an installable web application and receive push notifications.

### PushApi
Push notifications are the envy of web developers when comparing web apps to mobile apps. A study by Localytics shows that app retention is doubled for push-enabled mobile apps and increased by 278% for e-commerce apps,, making them the key feature for getting users back to your app.
